## Installation
After you get the repo, simply use "npm install" (use npm audit fix in case there's some issues)

You will now need to create the .env file in your server, and you will need to add:
"API_BASE_URL=http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/"
and
"API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key"
Be sure to generate your own api key with your account in the open wather site. It might take a couple of hours to work.

## Usage
Finally, you simply us "npm start"
Now you can start searching for any city you want!
